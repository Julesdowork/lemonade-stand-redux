# Lemonade Stand
## A Julian McNeill Experience

### About
It ain't easy being 10-years-old. School five days a week. Parents nagging you.
And you've got no money! Well, you can at least do something about that last
part. Build a lemonade stand, of course! In this summer heat, everyone needs a
cool, refreshing glass of the 'nade to help them unwind. You can provide that...
for a price of course.
